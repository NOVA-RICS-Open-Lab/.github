At RICS we conduct research, create concepts, develop technologies and integrate them for an agile, antifragile, and sustainable industrial society. Our core competencies are Intelligent Complex Systems and Robotics using the RIGHT (Responsive, Innovative, Green, Human-centered, Trustworthy) technologies to be applied in different industry sectors.

In this Lab we are seeking to create an open space for knowledge sharing with students and academia. Join us on our mission to push boundaries and make it accessible to everyone! 💡
